    <p>A good age to start you piano lesson would be at the age of 6.</p>
    <p>Lessons would be Western Classical, both theory and practical lessons, following the Trinity College of Music curriculum.</p>
    <p>Every student would an opportunity to perform at an annual concert â€“ an exciting time for the children to showcase their talent and also display their improvement over time. There would be exciting gifts and prizes to be won as well.</p>
    <h2>Free Trial/Inroductory Class</h2>
    <p>We offer a Free trial or introductory class which allows the student to meet the teacher. More importantly, it gives me an idea where to begin with and what is the experience that the student is looking forward to.</p>
    <h2>Private Lessons</h2>
    <p>Private lessons provide a personal approach. All practical lessons after Grade 2 are private one-on-one lessons.  At some stage, we could think of performing duets or group playing to encourage social interactions during practical lessons as well.</p>

    <h2>Group Lessons</h2>
    <p>Group activities and lessons provide interaction, fun, peer learning. This is essential for the beginners and during the initial learning stages. The group lessons are particularly useful for the initial theory lessons, while learning notes, reading sheet music, understanding rhythm and tempo etc.</p>
